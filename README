- There's a slew of interesting, tough and some impossible interview questions out there.
- Usually I stop and move on when I figure out the algorithm or the preliminary solution (or find out the solution somewhere from the net)
- This repo is meant to contain those problems that I actually had the patience to code out. 
- On account of mental and intellectual limitations and pure laziness, the solutions might not be "the" best.
- I have started doing this for two main reasons - 
  i) Practise for the white-board coding 
 ii) A chance to show off
